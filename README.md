This project creates 2 deques, one for strings and another for integers. It uses dynamic memory.
You can use the ./proj3B <proj3B_input.scr> command to "unscramble" the input from the .scr file or manually enter strings or ints.
I really enjoy making linked lists as they are a fun departure from arrays!
